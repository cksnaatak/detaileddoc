## Conclusion

All the three VCS's  GitLab, Bitbucket, and GitHub offer powerful features for version control and project collaboration. **GitLab** stands out with its robust CI/CD integration and built-in container registry, making it ideal for teams focused on DevOps practices. **Bitbucket** excels in its support for both Git and Mercurial repositories and seamless integration with other Atlassian tools like Jira and Confluence, which is beneficial for teams already in that ecosystem. **GitHub**, with its extensive integrations and large community support, is a preferred choice for many developers and teams due to its usability and feature-rich platform.
 
 overall we can say that **Github** is the best VCS for its usability & capabilities 

 Personally, I am currently using **GitHub** for my needs as per requirements  in the organization.
